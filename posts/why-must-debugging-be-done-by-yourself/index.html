			<p>If someone points out where your program is wrong, you won&rsquo;t gain any insight, and you may repeat the same mistake next time. This is because the errors you discover through extensive debugging leave a deeper impression. Debugging ability is a key measure of a coder&rsquo;s productivity and can enhance your capacity to write high-quality, bug-free code.</p>
<p>This leads me to think about the steps of debugging—not just to fix the issue, but also to push myself to delve deeper. Here are my four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reread the program. Follow the thought process you had when writing it and check if the program is executing as you intended. Use print statements to log intermediate results. I call this &ldquo;debugging by observation without compiling.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Find a very small input that can cause your program to fail. This means you are &ldquo;pretending&rdquo; to run the program with actual input while reasoning about the expected output.</li>
<li>If you encounter any unexpected behavior, narrow down the problem and ensure it remains within your scope.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-really-cant-debug">What To Do If You Really Can&rsquo;t Debug?</h2>
<p>If you have been debugging for an entire day and still can&rsquo;t find a solution, it&rsquo;s okay to ask someone else for help. However, make sure you have <strong>thoroughly</strong> explored the problem yourself first. Don&rsquo;t rush to seek assistance without thinking deeply about the issue.
