			<h3 id="types-of-junk">Types of Junk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editors and compliers</strong>: They quote vague ideas, rephrase and add their own viewpoints without substantial material to support them. After reading, one feels they have gained something, but cannot specify what that gain is.</li>
<li><strong>Public Intellectuals and Popular Science</strong>: Much of the content is merely a rearrangement of introductory knowledge, lacking depth in more complex areas, while important points remain vague. It may be acceptable for initial exposure, but once familiar, one should read well-recognized, time-tested books in the field to build a complete knowledge framework. See what to submit in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"><strong>Hacker News Guidelines</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<p>On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one&rsquo;s intellectual curiosity.<br>
Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, or celebrities, unless they&rsquo;re evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they&rsquo;d cover it on TV news, it&rsquo;s probably off-topic.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Exporters</strong>: Many blogs consist of lists of basic knowledge and common sense to prevent future forgetfulness or to document personal experiences and solutions found online. However, experiences are often someone else&rsquo;s, and blindly copying without any filtering can lead to negative consequences (such as getting bogged down in details or conflicting with existing knowledge). It is best to combine current application scenarios with hands-on practice and create an index of related knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="characteristics-of-junk">Characteristics of Junk</h3>
<ul>
<li>No topic, no conclusion.</li>
<li>Easily accessible content that lacks personal thought, even devoid of viewpoints.(ZX: Might be informative?)</li>
<li>Based on speculation, failing to reach/converge to the essence of the problem.</li>
<li>Draws conclusions too easily and offers excessive summaries.</li>
<li>Lacks quantitative analysis, relying on subjective feelings and exceptions as evidence.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="avoid-recommendation-system-active-search-vs-passive-recommendation">Avoid Recommendation System. Active Search vs. Passive Recommendation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active Search</strong>: Forms value systems; time-consuming (infinite choices = infinite energy + infinite time).</li>
<li><strong>Passive Recommendation</strong>: Hinders cognitive processes; allows time for reflection.</li>
<li><strong>Distinction</strong>: Whether there is a need for a gatekeeper to filter information. I want to make it at least visible. It is wise to listen to multiple perspectives instead of hiding yourself into a information Cocoons / Echo Chamber</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge and perception are not the same as opinion. Knowledge is built on <strong>rationality</strong>; it is a judgment based on a thorough understanding of that judgment.</p>
<p>Reading is not about acquiring others&rsquo; thoughts but about supplementing one&rsquo;s own thoughts through contemplation of others&rsquo; ideas. It is merely a means, while independent thinking is the goal of general knowledge. Learning is not about exploring known knowledge but about investigating the unknown (one&rsquo;s own unknowns). So Researching instead of learning.</p>
<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attitude Towards Knowledge</strong>: Accurately assess the role of current knowledge. Understanding—archiving; comprehension—revisiting (Feynman learning technique); application—output or usage, summarizing models and methodologies.</li>
<li><strong>Time Management</strong>: Do not mistake using time for being productive. How to judge waste? Can you output now, a week later, or a year later?</li>
<li><strong>Self-Reflection</strong>: Life&rsquo;s exam has no test paper; asking oneself is equal to setting one&rsquo;s own questions.</li>
<li><strong>Information Filtering</strong>: Stop focusing on knowledge and information that may be useful in the future; minimize aimless browsing and searching. After careful thought, seek and identify information and knowledge, anticipate questions, and eliminate blind spots.](&lt;Here is the revised version of the notes, along with a list of changes made for clarity:</li>
