<p>I have never classified the types of books I read because I didn&rsquo;t want to put too much stress on reading. Instead, I always followed my interests. However, considering that reading is a lifelong pursuit that requires consistency, I have decided to reexamine my motivation. There are two shortcomings when we solely follow our interests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blindly reading without direction can be a time-killer. Time is limited, so optimizing the return on interest (ROI) is important in the long run.</li>
<li>It is not beneficial to stay within our comfort zones. Deliberate reading can help expand our knowledge and push the boundaries of our understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>To address this problem, I am going to prioritize my reading materials based on different categories, similar to how we prioritize our endless work tasks. I have created this list for myself, and it should be adjusted dynamically. There are also more subtopics that can be explored, which can be seen as fractals(I love this word from Paul Graham BTW) in expanding our knowledge.</p>
